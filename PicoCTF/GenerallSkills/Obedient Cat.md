### Description

If I told you a word started with 0x70 in hexadecimal, what would it start with in ASCII?

### Hints
1. Any hints about entering a command into the Terminal (such as the next one), will start with a '$'... everything after the dollar sign will be typed (or copy and pasted) into your Terminal.
2. To get the file accessible in your shell, enter the following in the Terminal prompt: `$ wget https://mercury.picoctf.net/static/0e428b2db9788d31189329bed089ce98/flag`
3. $ man cat

### Solución 
```
❯ cat flag
picoCTF{s4n1ty_v3r1f13d_2fd6ed29}
```
