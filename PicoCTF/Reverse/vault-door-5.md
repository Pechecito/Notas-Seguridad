In the last challenge, you mastered octal (base 8), decimal (base 10), and hexadecimal (base 16) numbers, but this vault door uses a different change of base as well as URL encoding! The source code for this vault is here:Â [VaultDoor5.java](https://jupiter.challenges.picoctf.org/static/9505cca05dc00fecead41106370ee619/VaultDoor5.java)

## HInts
